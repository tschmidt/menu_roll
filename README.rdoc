= jQuery Plugin: menu_roll

+menu_roll+ is based on a technique I saw used on Chris Woods' portfolio site
(http://chriswoods.ca). The basic idea is to make each menu item appear to "roll"
down on mouseover and then "roll" up on mouseout.

I have added the option to specify the easing that is used for the effect as well
ass the speed and roll over color.
